##  DataCollection&PreparationPractice.ipynb
### Overview 
The objective of this project is to collect a dataset from one or more open web APIs, and use Python to preprocess and analyse the collected data.
### Tasks
1) Choose at least one open web APIs as data source (not static datasets).
2) Collect data from your API(s) using Python. Depending on the API(s), you may need to repeat the collection process multiple times to download sufficient data.
3) Parse the collected data, and store it in an appropriate file format for subsequent analysis (e.g. plain text, JSON, XML, CSV).
4) Load and represent the data using an appropriate data structure. Apply any preprocessing steps that might be required to clean/filter/combine the data before analysis.
5) Analyse and summarise the cleaned dataset, using tables and visualisations where appropriate.
